Safely add/remove a mod from existing games.

Note: After installing a modification into an existing game, it takes some time before the timings are available - all vehicles must complete one cycle of the schedule. The same applies when a new vehicle with a new route is added and there isn't vehicle with same stations.
In order to display the sum of data for all vehicles on the same route, all vehicles need to have fully loaded data.
